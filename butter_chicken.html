        <li>In a large bowl, combine the yogurt, lemon juice, cumin, coriander, turmeric, garam masala, chili powder, and salt. Add the chicken pieces and coat them well with the marinade. Cover and refrigerate for at least 1 hour, or overnight for best results.</li>
        <li>Heat 1 tablespoon of butter in a large skillet or pan over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and cook until softened and golden brown, about 5-7 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the minced garlic and grated ginger to the pan and cook for another 1-2 minutes until fragrant.</li>
        <li>Add the crushed tomatoes to the pan and cook for about 10 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the sauce thickens and the oil starts to separate from the tomatoes.</li>
        <li>Reduce the heat to low and stir in the heavy cream. Simmer the sauce for another 5 minutes. Season with salt to taste.</li>
        <li>In a separate pan, heat the remaining 2 tablespoons of butter over medium-high heat. Add the marinated chicken pieces and cook until they are cooked through and slightly charred, about 5-7 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the cooked chicken pieces to the sauce and stir to coat them well. Simmer for another 5 minutes to allow the flavors to meld together.</li>
        <li>Garnish with fresh cilantro leaves and serve hot with cooked basmati rice or naan bread.</li>
    </ol>
