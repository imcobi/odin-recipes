    <h2> How to Cook Salmon </h2>
    <p> This salmon dish features a perfectly seared fillet with a crisp golden crust on the outside and tender, flaky flesh inside. <br> The natural richness of the salmon is enhanced with a light seasoning of sea salt, cracked black pepper, and a squeeze of<br> fresh lemon juice, bringing out its delicate flavor. Served over a bed of roasted vegetables, the dish balances heartiness<br> with freshness, creating a vibrant and nourishing meal. A drizzle of herb-infused butter sauce ties everything together, <br> a fragrant layer of garlic, parsley, and dill that complements the salmon’s savory profile. The contrast of textures—crispy<br> skin, moist fish, and caramelized vegetables—makes each bite satisfying. Elegant yet simple, this salmon dish can stand as<br> a wholesome weeknight dinner or a centerpiece for a more refined occasion.</p>

        <li>Preheat your oven to 400°F (200°C).</li>
        <li>Pat the salmon fillet dry with paper towels. Season both sides with salt and pepper.</li>

        <li>Cook for about 4-5 minutes without moving it, allowing the skin to crisp up.</li>
        <li>Carefully flip the salmon fillet and cook for another 2 minutes on the other side.</li>
        <li>Add minced garlic and lemon slices around the salmon in the skillet.</li>
        <li>If using, add a tablespoon of butter to the skillet, letting it melt and baste the salmon.</li>
        <li>Transfer the skillet to the preheated oven and bake for an additional 5-7 minutes, or until the salmon is cooked through and flakes easily with a fork.</li>
        <li>Remove from the oven and let it rest for a couple of minutes. Garnish with fresh herbs before serving.</li>
